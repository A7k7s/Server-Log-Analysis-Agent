# Agentic Server Log Analysis using Groq

This project is an **Agentic AI-based Server Log Analysis System**.  
Instead of running a fixed script, this system behaves like an **intelligent agent**:

- It understands what stage of analysis the system is in  
- Decides which operation to perform next  
- Processes large logs intelligently  
- Generates meaningful insights automatically  

The agent does not blindly follow a pipeline.  
It **thinks, decides, and acts** step-by-step like a real AI system.

## ⭐ What It Does
- Automatically extracts error logs
- Groups similar errors using semantic understanding
- Finds frequency patterns & recurring failures
- Uses Groq LLM to generate an **executive summary**
- Saves a professional **PDF report**
- Completely automated agentic workflow

## 🤖 What Makes It “Agentic”?
In a normal project:
> You manually call functions in a fixed order.

In this project:
> The **LLM decides which tool to call next**.

The agent:
1️⃣ Knows which tools are completed  
2️⃣ Decides the next best tool using reasoning  
3️⃣ Executes tools like a thinking AI  
4️⃣ Finally asks the LLM to write an intelligent report  

So instead of being a “script”, it behaves like a **decision-making AI analyst**.
